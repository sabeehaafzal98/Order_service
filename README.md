ðŸ§¾ Statement: Understanding Feign Fallbacks and Circuit Breakers â€” From Hystrix to Resilience4j
The concept of Feign fallback emerged as a critical resilience pattern in microservices architecture, allowing applications to gracefully degrade functionality when a downstream service fails. Initially, this was powered by Netflix Hystrix, a pioneering library that introduced circuit breakers, thread isolation, and fallback mechanisms directly into Feign clients using the fallback attribute.

With Hystrix, developers could define a fallback class that would be invoked when a remote call failed due to timeouts, exceptions, or open circuits. This made it easy to build fault-tolerant systems. However, as the ecosystem evolved, Hystrix was officially deprecated and moved to maintenance mode, with Spring Cloud removing support for it in newer versions.

This shift led to the adoption of Resilience4j, a modern, lightweight, and modular alternative. Unlike Hystrix, Resilience4j does not integrate directly with Feignâ€™s fallback attribute. Instead, it encourages wrapping Feign calls inside service methods and applying annotations like @CircuitBreaker, @Retry, or @RateLimiter to control behavior. Fallbacks are now defined as separate methods, giving developers more flexibility and observability.

There are two main types of fallbacks in this context:

Static fallback classes (used with Hystrix): Implement the Feign interface and return default responses.
Dynamic fallback methods (used with Resilience4j): Defined alongside the business logic and triggered based on runtime exceptions or circuit breaker states.
Today, Resilience4j is the recommended approach for building resilient microservices in Spring Boot, offering better integration with reactive programming, metrics, and fine-grained control over failure handling.

have added retry mechanism to microservices application, also can check the metrics via the postman-url. 
have added prometheus dependency to check :- 
We can check the urls like this :-
